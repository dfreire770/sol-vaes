Sound Generation using Conditional Variational Autoencoders

Generative Models are playing an important role in current developments in Artificial Intelligence applied to different areas such as Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Similarly, the field of generative audio models is constantly evolving, and it shows promising results. Ths repository contains various experiments to explore the efficacy of Variational Autoencoders and Conditional Variational Autoencoders in capturing and synthesizing diverse features from recordings of Musical Instruments. By training these models on spectrograms, it is possible to generate high-fidelity sound representations under different conditions.
